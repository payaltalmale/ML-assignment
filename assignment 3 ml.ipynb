The unsupervised models can be trained using the unlabelled dataset that is not classified, nor categorized, and the algorithm needs to act on that data without any supervision. In unsupervised learning, the model doesn't have a predefined output, and it tries to find useful insights from the huge amount of data. These are used to solve the Association and Clustering problems. \n",

    "\n",
    "there are a few tasks which ML fails to answer\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Reasoning Power\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, if an image recognition algorithm identifies apples and oranges in a given scenario, it cannot say if the apple (or orange) has gone bad or not, or why is that fruit an apple or orange. Mathematically, all of this learning process can be explained by us, but from an algorithmic perspective, the innate property cannot be told by the algorithms or even us.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Contextual Limitation\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If we consider the area of natural language processing (NLP), text and speech information are the means to understand languages by NLP algorithms. They may learn letters, words, sentences or even the syntax, but where they fall back is the context of the language. Algorithms do not understand the context of the language used. A classic example for this would be the “Chinese room” argument given by philosopher John Searle, which says that computer programs or algorithms grasp the idea merely by ‘symbols’ rather than the context given. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, ML does not have an overall idea of the situation. It is limited by mnemonic interpretations rather than thinking to see what is actually going on.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Scalability\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "we see ML implementations being deployed on a significant basis, it all depends on data as well as its scalability. Data is growing at an enormous rate and has many forms which largely affects the scalability of an ML project. Algorithms cannot do much about this unless they are updated constantly for new changes to handle data. This is where ML regularly requires human intervention in terms of scalability and remains unsolved mostly.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Regulatory Restriction For Data In ML\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "ML usually need considerable amounts (in fact, massive) of data in stages such as training, cross-validation etc. Sometimes, data includes private as well as general information. This is where it gets complicated. Most tech companies have privatised data and these data are the ones which are actually useful for ML applications. But, there comes the risk of the wrong usage of data, especially in critical areas such as medical research, health insurance etc.,\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though data are anonymised at times, it has the possibility of being vulnerable. Hence this is the reason regulatory rules are imposed heavily when it comes to using private data.\n",

    "1. Regression\n",
    "Regression is used to understand the relationship between dependable and independent variables. Moreover, it is a type of supervised learning that learns from labelled data sets to predict continuous output for different data in an algorithm. It is believed to be widely used in scenarios where the output needs to be a finite value, for instance, height or weight, etc.\n",
    "There two types of regression; they are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear regression\n",
    "It is used to identify the relationship between two variables, typically used for making future predictions. Moreover, linear regression is sub-divided based on the number of independent and dependent variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, if there is one independent and one dependent variable, it is known as simple linear regression. Meanwhile, if there are two or more independent and dependent variables, it is called multiple linear regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic regression \n",
    "Logistic regression is used when the dependent variable is categorical or has binary outputs like ‘yes’ or ‘no’. Moreover, logistic regression is used to solve binary classification problems; that’s why it predicts discreet values for variables.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Naive Bayes\n",
    "A Naive Bayes algorithm is used for large datasets. The approach works on the fundamental that every programme in the algorithm works independently. This means that the presence of one feature will not impact the other. Generally, it is used in text classification, recommendation systems, and others.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are different types of Naive Bayes models, and the decision tree remains the most popular among business organizations. A decision tree is a unique supervised learning algorithm structurally resembling a flowchart. However, they fundamentally perform different roles and responsibilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "A decision tree consists of control statements containing decisions and their consequences. The output in a decision tree relates to the labelling of unforeseen data. ID3 and CART are some of the popular decision tree algorithms widely used across various industries.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Classification\n",
    "It is a type of supervised learning algorithm that accurately assigns data into different categories or classes. It recognizes specific entities and analyses them to conclude where those entities must be categorized. Some of the classification algorithms are as follows:\n",
    "\n",

    "This type of supervised learning algorithm is used to group or categorize raw data. In addition, it is used for finding a pattern or interpreting sensory data. However, the algorithm requires numerous amounts of computation resources. As a result, its uses are constrained.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Random forest\n",

    "# 9. What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning? With a sample applicationin each region, explain the differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main distinction between the two approaches is the use of labeled datasets. To put it simply, supervised learning uses labeled input and output data, while an unsupervised learning algorithm does not.\n",
    "\n",
    "In supervised learning, the algorithm “learns” from the training dataset by iteratively making predictions on the data and adjusting for the correct answer. While supervised learning models tend to be more accurate than unsupervised learning models, they require upfront human intervention to label the data appropriately. For example, a supervised learning model can predict how long your commute will be based on the time of day, weather conditions and so on. But first, you’ll have to train it to know that rainy weather extends the driving time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unsupervised learning models, in contrast, work on their own to discover the inherent structure of unlabeled data. Note that they still require some human intervention for validating output variables. For example, an unsupervised learning model can identify that online shoppers often purchase groups of products at the same time. However, a data analyst would need to validate that it makes sense for a recommendation engine to group baby clothes with an order of diapers, applesauce and sippy cups.\n",
    "\n",
    "In supervised learning, the goal is to predict outcomes for new data. You know up front the type of results to expect. With an unsupervised learning algorithm, the goal is to get insights from large volumes of new data. The machine learning itself determines what is different or interesting from the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Applications: Supervised learning models are ideal for spam detection, sentiment analysis, weather forecasting and pricing predictions, among other things. In contrast, unsupervised learning is a great fit for anomaly detection, recommendation engines, customer personas and medical imaging.\n"
