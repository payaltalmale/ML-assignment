    "an abstract class is a class  its purpose not only create object from class its purpose is to define how other classes should like  i.e. what methods and properties they are expected to have.The methods and properties defined (but not implemented) in an abstract class are called abstract methods and abstract properties. All abstract methods and properties need to be implemented in a child class in order to be able to create objects from it  "
